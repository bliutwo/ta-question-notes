# Concerning the "Updated Probability"

**Caveat**: So although I'm a little lost here, Giovanni pointed me to specific things. Hopefully me sending this to you all will help the brains go to the right direction:

## Big takeaways

- So it seems like we're supposed to use equations on the slides, **Bayesian Updating to Website.pdf**.

- Giovanni specified that We want to update with the specific equation(s) on slide **"Your Posterior Is the Product"**.
   
- Giovanni also pointed me towards using the following:
  - Steph Curry xls (excel spreadsheet that we looked at yesterday)
  - "Freemark Abbey Historical.pdf"

- For "Freemark Abbey Historical.pdf", he said something specific: we want to use the "successes and failures" per each year to also update the probability.

## Misc. notes

I wrote down

```
update with posterior

binomial
```

and next page

```
"prior distribution -> updating formula"

and

"use abbey historical to update distribution"
```

and earlier, about the Bayesian Updating,

```
xls

talk to interviewee for fancier updating

"we're giving the interviewee discretion for fancier extra credit stuff"
```
