# Concerning the "Updated Probability"

So it seems like we're supposed to use equations on the slides, "Bayesian Updating to Website.pdf".

We want to update with equation(s) on slide "Your Posterior Is the Product", and Giovanni also pointed me to:

- Steph Curry xls (excel spreadsheet that we looked at yesterday)
- "Freemark Abbey Historical.pdf"

For "Freemark Abbey Historical.pdf", we also want to use the "successes and failures" per each year to also update the probability.

I wrote down

```
"prior distribution -> updating formula"

and

"use abbey historical to update distribution"
```
